# Introduction

In this lab the team tested a ATM simulator using different testing methods. The methods used were exploratory testing and manual testing. The groups goal was to get better acquainted using industry standard tools such as GitHub and Jira and to work well as a team, simulating a future work environment. The group had some experience doing exploratory testing as one of the group members had an internship working as a Quality Assurance Engineer at a Calgary start-up. 
# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The plan for the exploratory testing was to split up into two pairs and then to split up the major features of the app in between the groups. Group 1 was responsible for start-up, withdrawal and deposit while group 2 was responsible for transfer and balance inquiry. The plan for the exploratory testing was to test these components by running one test we expect to pass, one test we expect to fail and then run boundary tests to check how well the exceptions were handled. The group was successful and we were able to spot many errors that were repeated during the manual testing. 

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Manual functional testing allowed the group to perform regression testing. Since all the tests that we did were written down, we were able to test them again after the system had been updated by the developers. This is difficult to do with the way we did our exploratory testing, as we did not write down every test that we ran and every result. However, exploratory testing allowed us to go beyond the confines of the manual functional testing and find software breaking bugs that are unexpected and hard to test. For example, we found a bug that if you are on the balance inquiry page and press 4 twice, money is released from the ATM without charging any account. This is not something we would have found without the exploratory testing. 

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

Working in pairs improved the quality of our defect reports.  During exploratory testing, peer review allowed us to prevent duplicate bug reports.  During manual scripted testing, we reviewed each other's defect reports in order to ensure that we had correctly interpreted the test as well as the software requirements related to the tests.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Pair testing was managed by having one member run the program and conduct tests while the other team member wrote down the found bugs onto jira. The team members would then switch roles for the second half of the tests. Between the two teams the major components were divided. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Some of the difficulties encountered was properly wording bug reports. It is important to stay concise and descriptive at the same time, something that is hard to achieve without practice. The team learned how to customize, create, update, and filter bug reports using Jira. Learning how to configure Jira for the needs of the assignment required a learning curve, but was a learning experience that will be useful in future software projects. We had difficulty interpreting parts of the instructions at times, but overcoming these challenges allowed us to build team cohesion. The team learned the difference between manual testing and exploratory testing, and the importance of each type of testing in the development process. 

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

The team felt that the lab was interesting and provided an introduction to the testing process that will be useful for future assignments, software projects, and tasks we will be assigned in industry.
